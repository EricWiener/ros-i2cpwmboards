<p><b>FILE STRUCTURE AND CODE</b></p>
<p>The file is broken into sections:</p><ul>
<li>private properties (all private properties have a leading underscore)</li>
<li>private methods (all private methods have a leading underscore)</li>
<li>public methods subscribers for topics</li>
<li>public methods services</li>
</ul>
<p>The code is currently authored in C and should be rewritten as proper C++.</p>
<p>This documentation refers to 'servo' and 'RC servo' but is equally applicable to any PWM or PPM controlled motor.</p>
<p>All published services and topics use a one-based count syntax. For example, the first servo is '1' and the default board is '1'. The hardware uses zero-based values. For example the first channel on the 16 channel 12-bit PWM board is '0' and the first I2C board is '0' with address 0x40. The switch from one-based to zero-based is done at the lowest level of this code. All public interactions should assume one-based values.</p>
<p><b>USING PWM WITH SERVOS</b></p>
<p>While the PCA9685 chip and related boards are called "PWM" for pulse width modulation, there use with servos is more accurately PPM for pulse position modulation.</p>
<p>For standard 180 degree servos with a motion arc of ±90 degrees the pulse moves the servo arm to specifc position and holds it. For continuous motion servos, the pulse moves the servo at a specific speed.</p>
<p>The documentation will refer to positon, speed or position/speed. These are interchangeable as the two terms are dependent on whether the servo is a fixed rotation servo or a continuous rotation servo and independent of the board itself.</p>
<p>Analog RC servos are most often designed for 20ms pulses. This is achieved with a frequency of 50Hz. This software defaults to 50Hz. Use the set_pwm_frequncy() to change this frequency value. It may be necessary or convenient to change the PWM frequency if using DC motors connected to PWM controllers. It may also be convenient if using PWM to control LEDs.</p>
<p>A commonly available board is the Adafruit 16 channel 12-bit PWM board or the similarly named HAT. There are similar boards as well as clones. All of these boards use the PCA9685 chip. Not all boards have been tested.</p>
<p>The PWM boards drive LED and servos using pulse width modulation. The 12 bit interface means values are in the range of 0..4096. The pulse is defined as a start value and end value. When driving servos, the start point is typically 0 and the end point is the duration.</p>
<p>FYI: If using more than one PWM board or when using a board with an I2C address other than the default 0x40, the <a class="el" href="group___services.html#gae3a9251a5afb53de589256f5b3b5f82b" title="service to set active PWM board ">set_pwm_active_board()</a> service must be used before using other services or topics from this package.</p>
<p><b>CONFIGURING SERVOS</b></p>
<p>The tolerance of the resistors in RC servos means each servo may have a slightly different center point.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="group___topics.html#gaa3fe8c6f5a98243c302c0d27cea219d9" title="subscriber topic to move servos in a physical position ">servos_absolute()</a> topic controls servos with absolute pulse start and stop values. This topic subscriber is not generally useful in robot operations, however it is conveninet for testing and for determining configuration values. Use this topic to determine the center position for a standard servo or the stop position for a continuous servo.</p>
<p>Also use this topic to determine the range of each servo - either the ±90 postion for a standard servo or the max forward and reverse speed for a continuous rotation servo.</p>
<p><b>note:</b> The centering value and range of servos is dependent on the pulse frequency. If you change the frequency, you will need to determine new center and range values.</p>
<p>Use the <a class="el" href="group___services.html#gabf512716d4497c6a4cb7bf9c5d94e2f1" title="store configuration data for servos on the active board ">config_servos()</a> service to set the center values and range values for servos. This enables servo motion to be generalized to a standard proportion ±1000. Servo configuration is a prerequisite to using the <a class="el" href="group___topics.html#ga1262b2e51072c237c51b6de4cb199e53" title="subscriber topic to move servos in the range of ±1000 ">servos_proportional()</a> topic subscriber. It is also a requirement before using the config_drive() servie API and its related <a class="el" href="group___topics.html#gae257665eb64139d2720ed332e61507c6" title="subscriber topic to move servos based on a drive mode ">servos_drive()</a> topic subscriber.</p>
<p><b>ROBOT DRIVE MODE</b></p>
<p>In addition to absolute and proportional topics for controling servos, this package provides support for the geometry 'Twist' message. The <a class="el" href="group___topics.html#gae257665eb64139d2720ed332e61507c6" title="subscriber topic to move servos based on a drive mode ">servos_drive()</a> topic handles the calculations to covert linear and angular data to servo drive data. This package supports three drive modes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>'ackerman' - single drive with external automobile style steering</li>
<li>'differential' - skid steer or track steer using a servo (or servos) for each of the left and right. A very simple algorythm is used. The result is the ability to perform zero-radius turns at a maximum of 50% speed and a full speed full turn (controller with max forward/reverse and max left/right is equal to the wheel base.</li>
<li>'mecanum' - requires a servo (or multiple servos) for each of left-front, right-front, left-rear, and right-rear wheels. Similar drive characteristics to differential drive with teh additional of lateral motion.</li>
</ol>
<p>The servos on the PWM board are assigned to their respective drive positons using the <a class="el" href="group___services.html#gae3222f92a0cd33b0d0a2fcfd6d563ba9" title="set drive mode and drive servos ">config_drive_mode()</a> service. The applicable servos are assigned positions as follows:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>positon </th><th>ackerman </th><th>differential </th><th>mecanum  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>position 1 corresponds to </td><td>drive </td><td>left </td><td>left-front </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>position 2 corresponds to </td><td></td><td>right </td><td>right-front </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>position 3 corresponds to </td><td></td><td></td><td>left-rear </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>position 4 corresponds to </td><td></td><td></td><td>right-rear </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The drive topic requires that use of both the <a class="el" href="group___services.html#gabf512716d4497c6a4cb7bf9c5d94e2f1" title="store configuration data for servos on the active board ">config_servos()</a> service and <a class="el" href="group___services.html#gae3222f92a0cd33b0d0a2fcfd6d563ba9" title="set drive mode and drive servos ">config_drive_mode()</a> service before drive mode will result in expected behavior.</p>
<p>All non-drive servos may still be operated with the proportion or absolute topics.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="group___services.html#ga4583b417d172bde68e75db603da3362e" title="service to stop all servos on all boards ">stop_servos()</a> service is provided as convenience to stop all servos and place then is a powered off state. The stop service is useful as a safety operation.</p>
<p><b>TESTING</b></p>
<p>Basic testing is available from the command line. Start the I2C PWM node with <code>roslaunch i2cpwm_board i2cpwm_node.launch</code> and then proceed with any of the <em>rostopic example</em> and <em>rosservice example</em> commands contained within the documentation for each service and topic subscriber. </p>
