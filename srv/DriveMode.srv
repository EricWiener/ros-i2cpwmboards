# the drive_mode service is used to assigned servos to various drive modes
# the drive modes determine how the assigned servos respond to geometry_msgs::Twist messages
# drive modes are one of: ackerman, differential, or mecanum
# to accurately convert velocity in m/s the controller needs to know three values:
#   the RPM    - the maximum output speed available from the drive motors
#   the radius - the drive wheel radius in centimeters
#   the track  - the distance between the left and right wheels in centimeters
# use the scale value to adjust incoming Twist values as needed to match the servo/motor capability
